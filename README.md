# OPTIMIZATION MODEL

AI Task Allocation – Internship Task Documentation
COMPANY: CodTech IT Solutions
NAME: POOJA AK
DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE
DURATION: 4 Weeks
MENTOR: Neela Santosh

 DESCRIPTION OF TASK
I worked on developing an AI-Powered Task Allocation System for cross-functional product teams. The system leverages Linear Programming optimization (using PuLP) to assign tasks to team members based on:

 Matching technical skillsets

 Individual workload limits (e.g., max 12 hours)

 Task priority (e.g., higher priority = higher weight)

 Balanced workload distribution

The solution was built using Python, pandas, PuLP, and matplotlib, with two forms of deployment:

💻 Executed as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

🌐 Published on Streamlit.io for interactive use

 TECHNOLOGIES USED
Tool	Purpose
Python	Core language for all logic
pandas	Data handling (task/member tables)
PuLP	Linear programming optimization
matplotlib	Visual analytics
Streamlit.io	Web-based deployment platform

DEPLOYMENT METHODS
✅ Jupyter Notebook Execution
The solution was tested and executed successfully using the file:
AI_TaskAllocator.ipynb

 Read two CSV files: tasks.csv, members.csv

 Produced visualizations (workload & priority)

Displayed optimal assignments & total score

🌐 Online Deployment via Streamlit.io
Hosted on:
 AI Task Allocator App

 Allows uploading of task/member CSVs

 Generates optimal allocation dynamically

📊 Shows clean charts, tables, and outputs


🧾 SAMPLE OUTPUT (JUPYTER + STREAMLIT)
✅ Optimal Assignment Table (Notebook Output)scss

🧩 REST API Development → Riya (Backend Dev)
🧩 UI Setup → Amit (Frontend Dev)
🧩 SQL Report Generation → Neha (Data Analyst)
🧩 Feature Planning → Priya (Product Manager)

🎯 Total Priority Score: 24

🏁 CONCLUSION
This project demonstrates:

Real-world logic building through constraint optimization

Python and LP-based problem solving

Visual storytelling with charts

Deployment skills using notebook and Streamlit.io
It’s a strong addition to my resume and showcases my ability to build smart tools for effective team planning.
